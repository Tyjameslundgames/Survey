I have many things to add to this\r\nwebsite but first of all I have to giev a shout out to a really fun PVP/Roleplay server Firestars haven and the IP is mc.firestarshaven.com.\r\nI suggest joining this server because the staf are really nice and fair and so is everyone else. I know that because I have been on this server for\r\naround 3 years. Second of all Im sorry I havent been uploading so much but I promise I will be uploading a lot more now. I also might get a rank\r\nin hypixel, probly MVP+ and do more videos there to. Me and some of my friends are gonna make a minecraft server that is gonna be open\r\nto the public and is gonna have a lot of games and challenges. The best thing is that you dont need to pay for the ranks with\r\nreal money, you just get tons of kills and rank up. There will also be the first rank give away when 5 peopel are on (not including staff). </p>",
